# Model Weights Directory

Place your trained model weights here:
- resnet_v2.pth (PyTorch ResNet model)
- xgboost_final.json (XGBoost model)
- Any other model checkpoints

**Note:** This directory should be git-ignored if weights are large.
Consider using Git LFS or cloud storage for production deployments.
